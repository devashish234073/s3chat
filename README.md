# S3 Chat – A Serverless Cross-Account Messaging App

This project lets multiple AWS users send and receive text messages using Amazon S3 buckets as communication channels.
Each user has their own S3 bucket, and the Node.js app acts like a chat client — storing messages as text files in the sender’s and receiver’s buckets.

This is just a concept how if there is some sort of global id for messengers, we could be able to communicate from one messenger to another. Something that can help small companies build their messenger app and still thrive alongside big players.
